### devices.json
devices.json is an array of objects, each with several fields:

* `model`: should be the first thing on the line, and is the device's codename (`PRODUCT_DEVICE`) - e.g. `i9300`.
* `oem`: the manufacturer of the device. (`PRODUCT_BRAND`) - e.g. `Samsung`.
* `name`: the user-friendly name of the device - e.g. `Galaxy S III (International)`.
* `lineage_recovery`: (*optional*) whether or not to offer Lineage recovery downloads for this device. Defaults to `false`.
