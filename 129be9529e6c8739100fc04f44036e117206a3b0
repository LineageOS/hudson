      "message": "I don\u0027t know if this patch is a good idea or not. The Sprint G3/ls990 and V20/ls997 depended on CDMA voice which is gone if locked, while VoLTE is becoming a requirement for T-Mobile. People may have SIM unlocked versions of these two devices on other networks.\n\nI don\u0027t own a G3 or V20, and left Sprint for T-Mobile a few years ago pre-merger.\n\nThe T-Mobile versions of the G3/V20 aren\u0027t affected as to my understanding they support VoLTE.\n\nI\u0027ll set Code-Review and Verified to +1 anyways. I think we shouldn\u0027t build for devices built for networks which are gone, but am open to other opinions",
